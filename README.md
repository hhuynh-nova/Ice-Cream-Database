## Instructions to Execute the Application
1. Run the entire script of the ice-cream-schema.sql file. This will create a blank schema for the three entities: Employee, Customer, and Cust_Order.
2. Run the entire script of the ice-cream-data.sql file. This will insert all of the data into their respective entities.
3. Run the individual statements from the ice-cream-examples files. This will demonstrate the UPDATE, SELECT and DELETE queries.

In order to insert additional data, it is highly recommended to write the statement in the ice-cream-data.sql file and run that individual statement alone.
For all other queries, it is highly recommended to write the statement in the ice-cream-examples.sql file and run that individual statement alone.
